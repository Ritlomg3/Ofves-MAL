# Ofve's MAL Modern-Template
This is my personal MAL layout but you can publicly **fork**, or do whatever to get this working. I can not inquiry anything to help you set up everything. This is not something I'd really not want to give to everybody.
> Note that this is very hard to set up as you may not have any knowledge of setting this up.
Private/ whatever you can do anything with this resp
